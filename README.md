**Features**<br>
Five unique levels, each with new enemy waves<br>
Three different turret types with distinct capabilities<br>
Enemy pathfinding implemented using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm<br>
Wave-based enemy spawning with increasing difficulty<br>

**Technologies**<br>
Unity Engine for game development<br>
C# for core programming logic<br>
Breadth-First Search (BFS) for enemy pathfinding<br>
Unity UI System for menus and in-game UI<br>

**How to Play**<br>
Press the start button to begin the game.<br>
Select turrets and place them strategically along the path.<br>
Enemies follow a predetermined path based on BFS pathfinding.<br>
You start with 20 hitpoints, each surviving enemy decreases your hitpoints by 1.<br>
Earn coins to buy better turrets.<br>
